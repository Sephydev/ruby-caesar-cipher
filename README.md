# Ruby Caesar Cipher

Welcome to my first Ruby project!

This is a simple project made exclusively with Ruby.
To use it, you have to install Ruby.
Once Ruby is installed, open a Terminal, then go to the directory hosting the project.
Once in the project, do :

```
ruby caesar-cipher.rb
```

Then you just have to follow the instruction!

The project support :
  - negative key (number)
  - big key (number)

Have fun!
